proposed circular paths for the planets and accurate astronomical

showed that a planet moves round the Sun in an elliptical path which
has the Sun in one of its two foci. He also showed that a line joining
the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times as the
planet describes its path. Both these laws were first formulated for
the planet Mars, and published in <i>Astronomia Nova</i> (1609).<br>

third law, that the squares of the periods of planets are proportional
to the cubes of the mean radii of their paths, appeared in <i>Harmonice mundi</i> (1619) and, perhaps surprisingly in view of the above comments, was widely accepted right from the time of its publication.

<a name="19"></a>In 1679 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hooke.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hooke',550,800); return false;">Hooke</a> wrote a letter to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>.
In the letter he explained how he considered planetary motion to be the
result of a central force continuously diverting the planet from its
path in a straight line. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>
did not answer this directly but explained his own idea that the
rotation of the Earth could be proved from the fact that an object
dropped from the top of a tower should have a greater tangential
velocity than one dropped near the foot of the tower.

<a name="s19"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>
provided a sketch of the path that the particle would follow, quite
incorrectly showing it spiral towards the centre of the Earth. Hooke
replied that his theory of planetary motion would lead to the path of
the particle being an ellipse so that the particle, were it not for the
fact that the Earth was in the way, would return to its original
position after traversing the ellipse.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="23"></a>Newton, not one to like being corrected, had to admit that his original sketch was incorrect but he "corrected" <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hooke.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hooke',550,800); return false;">Hooke</a>'s sketch on the assumption that gravity was constant. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hooke.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hooke',550,800); return false;">Hooke</a> replied to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> that his own theory involved an inverse square law for gravitational attraction. Many years later <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hooke.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hooke',550,800); return false;">Hooke</a> was to claim priority for proposing the inverse square law of gravitation and used this letter to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> to support his claim.
</p><p align="justify">It is worth emphasising that there is a major
step to be made from an inverse square law of force to explain
planetary motion and a universal law of gravitation. Certainly the
motion of the Moon round the Earth was not seen to necessarily be part
of the same laws which govern the motion of the planets round the Sun.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="27"></a>Fifty years after these events <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>
was to record his own recollections of these events which, although
interesting, do not really agree with the known historical facts! [I
preserve <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s old English.]
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>In the same year I began to think of gravity extending to ye orb of
the Moon and (having found out how to estimate the force with wch globe
revolving within a sphere presses the surface of a sphere) from
Kepler's rule of the periodical times of the Planets being in
sesquialternate proportion to their distances from the centres of their
Orbs, I deduced that the forces wch keep the Planets in their Orbs must
reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about
wch they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the
Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth,
and found them answer pretty nearly. All this was in the two plague
years of 1665-1666... </i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="31"></a>In 1684 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Wren.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Wren',550,800); return false;">Wren</a>, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hooke.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hooke',550,800); return false;">Hooke</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a>
discussed, at the Royal Society, whether the elliptical shape of
planetary orbits was a consequence of an inverse square law of force
depending on the distance from the Sun. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a> wrote that
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>Mr Hook said that he had it, but that he would conceale it for some
time so that others, triing and failing might know how to value it,
when he should make it publick. </i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="35"></a>Later in the same year in August, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a> visited <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> in Cambridge and asked him what orbit a body would follow under an inverse square law of force

<a name="39"></a>Despite the claims by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> in the above quote, he had in fact proved this result in 1680 as a direct result of the letters from <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hooke.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hooke',550,800); return false;">Hooke</a>. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> indeed reworked his proof and sent a nine page paper <i>De motu corporum in gyrum</i> (On the motion of bodies in an orbit) to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a>.

All this was to develop over the next couple of years to become the basis for the <i>Principia</i>. 
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="41"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a> was largely responsible for ensuring that the <i>Principia</i> was published. He received <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s complete manuscript by April of 1687 but there were many problems not the least being that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> tried to prevent the publication of the Book III when <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hooke.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hooke',550,800); return false;">Hooke</a> claimed priority with the inverse square law of force.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="43"></a>In the <i>Principia</i> the problem of two attracting
bodies with an inverse square law of force is completely solved (in
Propositions 1-17, 57-60 in Book I). <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> argues that an inverse square law must give produce elliptical, parabolic or hyperbolic orbits.

<a name="45"></a>A bright comet had appeared on 14 November 1680. It
remained visible until 5 December 1680 when it moved too close to the
Sun to be observed. It reappeared two weeks later moving away from the
Sun along almost the same path along which it had approached. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>
found good agreement between its orbit and a parabola. He uses the
orbit of this comet, and comets in general, to support his inverse
square law of gravitation in the <i>Principia</i>.<br>
<br>

</p><p align="justify">
<a name="49"></a>In the <i>Principia</i> <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> also deduced <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Kepler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Kepler',550,800); return false;">Kepler</a>'s third law. He looked briefly (in Propositions 65 and 66) at the problem of three bodies. However <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> later said that an exact solution for three bodies
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>exceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind. </i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="53"></a>It is important at this stage to examine the problems which now arose. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>
had completely solved the theoretical problem of the motion of two
point masses under an inverse square law of attraction. For more than
two point masses only approximations to the motion of the bodies could
be found and this line of research led to a large effort by
mathematicians to develop methods to attack this three body problem.
However, the problem of the actual motion of the planets and moons in
the solar system was highly complicated by other considerations. </p><p align="justify">
Even if the Earth - Moon system were considered as a two body problem, theoretically solved in the <i>Principia</i>,
the orbits would not be simple ellipses. Neither the Earth nor the Moon
is a perfect sphere so does not behave as a point mass. This was to
lead to the development of mechanics of rigid bodies, but even this
would not give a completely accurate picture of the two body problem
since tidal forces mean that neither the Earth nor Moon is rigid.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="57"></a>The observational data used by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> in the <i>Principia</i> was provided by the Royal Greenwich Observatory. However modern scholars such as Richard Westfall claim that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>
sometimes adjusted his calculations to fit his theories. Certainly the
observational evidence could not be used to prove the inverse square
law of gravitation. Many problems relating observation to theory
existed at the time of the <i>Principia</i> and more would arise.

method and found almost parabolic orbits for a number of comets. When
he computed the orbits for three comets which had appeared in 1537,
1607 and one <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a> observed himself in 1682, he found that the characteristics of the orbits were almost identical. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a>
deduced they were the same comet and later was able to identify it with
one which had appeared in 1456 and 1378. He computed an elliptical
orbit for the comet and he noticed that Jupiter and Saturn were
perturbing the orbit slightly between each return of the comet. Taking
the perturbations into account <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a>
predicted the comet would return and reach perihelion (the point
nearest the Sun) on 13 April 1759. He gave an error of one month on
either side of this date. The comet was actually first seen again in
December 1758 reaching perihelion on 12 March 1759.

from 1760 onwards, seems to be the first to study the general problem
of three bodies under mutual gravitation (rather than looking at bodies
in the solar system) although at first he only considered the
restricted three body problem when one of the bodies has negligible
mass. When one body has negligible mass it is assumed that the motions
of the other two can be solved as a two body problem, the body of
negligible mass having no effect on the other two. Then the problem is
to determine the motion of the third body attracted to the other two
bodies which orbit each other. Even in this form the problem does not
lead to exact solutions. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Euler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Euler',550,800); return false;">Euler</a>, however, found a particular solution with all three bodies in a straight line.

published further major papers in 1783 and 1784 on the theory of

<a name="87">An important development occurred on 13 March 1781 when the astronomer William Herschel (father of </a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel.html">John Herschel</a>) observing in his private observatory in Bath, England found
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s89"><i>...  a curious either nebulous star or perhaps a comet.</i>
</a></p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s91">Almost immediately it was realised that it was a planet
and within a year of its discovery it was shown to have an almost
circular orbit. The name Uranus was eventually adopted although William
Herschel himself proposed Georgium Sidus (perhaps in the hope of more
funds from King George!) while in France it was known as Herschel until
the middle of the following century.

on 23 November 1785 in which he gave a theoretical explanation of all
the remaining major discrepancies between theory and observation of all
the planets and their moons excluding Uranus. He also addressed the
question of the stability of the solar system for the first time. This
work was to culminate in the publication of <i>Mécanique céleste </i>  (1799) in which, among many other important results, he claimed to prove the stability of the solar system.

Uranus in the early years of the 19th Century showed there were

next term of the sequence 19.6. </a></p><p align="justify">
<a name="104">A search was made for a planet at distance 2.8 and on 1
January 1801 G Piazzi discovered such a body. On 11 February Piazzi
fell ill and ended his observations. The new planet, unobserved by
other astronomers, passed behind the Sun and was lost. However </a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Gauss.html">Gauss</a> in a brilliant piece of work was able to compute an orbit from the small number of observations. In fact <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Gauss.html">Gauss</a>'
s method requires only 3 observations and is still essentially that
used today in calculating orbits. Ceres, so named by Piazzi, was found
to be where Gauss predicted by Olbers. Its distance from the Sun fitted
exactly the 2.8 prediction of the Titus-Bode law.

known period of 3.3 years. The period showed a periodic decrease which
Encke could not explain by perturbations by other planets.

<a name="s108">Work on the general three body problem during the 19th
Century had begun to take two distinct lines. One was the developing of
highly complicated methods of approximating the motions of the bodies.
The other line was to produce a sophisticated theory to transform and
integrate the equations of motion. The first of these lines was
celestial mechanics while the second was rational or analytic
mechanics. Both the theory of perturbations and the theory of
variations of the arbitrary constants were of major mathematical
significance as well as contributing greatly to the understanding of
planetary orbits.

in 1843 where he reduced the problem of two actual planets orbiting a
sun to the motion of two theoretical point masses. As a first
approximation the theoretical point masses orbited the centre of
gravity of the original system in ellipses. He then used a method,
first discovered by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Lagrange.html">Lagrange</a>, to compute the perturbations. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Bertrand.html">Bertrand</a> extended <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Jacobi.html">Jacobi</a>'s work in 1852.

<a name="114">By around 1840 irregularities in the orbit of Uranus
prompted many scientists to seek reasons them. Alexis Bouvard (a
collector of planetary data) proposed that a planet might explain the
irregularities and he wrote to the English Astronomer Royal </a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html">Airy</a> proposing this idea. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Bessel.html">Bessel</a> also proposed this solution to the problem but died before completing his calculations. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Delaunay.html">Delaunay</a>, famed for his work on the orbit of the Moon, investigated the perturbations in a paper of 1842. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Arago.html">Arago</a> urged <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html">Le Verrier</a> to work on the problem and on 1 June 1846 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html">Le Verrier</a>
showed that the irregularities could be explained by an unknown planet
and he determined the coordinates at which the planet would be found.
The astronomer Galle in Berlin found the new planet on 26 September
remarkably close to the position predicted by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html">Le Verrier</a>. The observations were confirmed on 29 September 1846 at the Paris observatory.

personal triumph however was somewhat diminished when, on 15 October, a
letter was published from the English astronomer Challis claiming that
John Couch <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html">Adams</a> of Cambridge University had made similar calculations to those of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html">Le Verrier</a> which he had completed in September 1845.

John <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel.html">Herschel</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html">Airy</a> also supported <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html">Adams</a>'
claim. In fact Challis had, after a long delay, begun to search for the
new planet on 29 July 1846. He observed it on 4 August but did not
compare his observations with those of the previous night so only
realised he had observed the planet after its discovery in Berlin about
7 weeks later. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Arago.html">Arago</a> was unimpressed by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html">Adams</a>' priority claims

out that there was a discrepancy of 38" per century between the
predicted motion of the perihelion (the point of closest approach of
the planet to the Sun) which was 527" per century and the observed
